## [Unreleased]

**ATTENTION**: This release contains breaking changes. Please take extra care when updating to this version.

### Added
* Added support for the `webp` format in the Images API.
* Introduced `RateLimitExceededException` for more specific error handling. **[BREAKING]**
* Allow injecting a custom Guzzle instance into `Client`.
* Allow fetching content in a single locale by adding the locale code to the query. **[BREAKING]**
  **MIGRATION:** To retain the old behavior set the default locale to `'*''` when creating the client. This could look
  like: `new Client($token, $spaceID, false, null, ['defaultLocale => '*'])`
* Allow setting the locale in which you work when creating the client.
* Allow overriding the URI used to connect with the Contentful API.
* The `select` operator can now be specified on queries.
* Introduced `InvalidQueryException` for more specific error handling. **[BREAKING]**
* Introduced `AccessTokenInvalidException` for more specific error handling. **[BREAKING]**
* Support for the `all` operator and passing arrays as `$value` in `Query::where()`.
* Support for ordering by multiple fields.

### Changed
* Changed the behavior of getting an array of links to not throw an exception when one of them has been deleted from the space. ([#19](https://github.com/contentful/contentful.php/pull/19))
* Removed the caching of `Asset` and `Entry` instances. **[BREAKING]**
* Changed the internal data format from object to array. This should make no observable difference to the public API.
* Moved all Exception classes to their own namespace. **[BREAKING]**
* Changed the signature of the constructor of `Contentful\Delivery\Client`. Several options are now in an options array. **[BREAKING]**
* The Sync API can now also be used with the Preview API. Only initial syncs are supported.

### Removed
* Dropped `BearerToken` to make it easier to inject custom Guzzle instances. **[BREAKING]**

### Fixed
* Assets that have no title would throw an uncaught exception.
* Handling of missing values for a locale in Assets. Solved by implementing fallback locales for Assets too.
* Fields that have the literal value `null` are now treated like they don't exist. Previously they might have causes a
fatal error. **Note:** This does not 100% match the behaviour of the Contentful API.
* The error message for `Query::setLimit` was incorrect.
